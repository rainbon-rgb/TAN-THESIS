Rabbit raising, if given attention and opportunity, can give a huge potential market. But because of a lack of local rabbit farms, the idea that this can be a lucrative livelihood that can significantly augment oneâ€™s income if managed properly is overlooked. Rabbit farming can be of help, especially amid the economic burden and hindrances caused by the ongoing health crisis.  A rabbit takes around 2 to 3 months to reach marketable size, while pigs take over double the period. Chickens are fully grown between 28 and 45 days. But while it takes less time to raise rabbits as compared to pigs, meat quality is also another issue that needs to be addressed.

This study generally aims to develop a web application that can help manage rabbit farms.

Specifically, it aims to: 
1.	To develop a registration module for rabbits to store and access rabbits' information.
2.	To develop a module to identify the breed, height, and width of rabbits. 
3.	To develop a monitoring system that can determine the rabbit's status and readiness for meat production.
4.	To comply with the ISO/IEC 25010 standards for systems and software engineering -Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) -System and software quality models providing characteristics and sub-characteristics for both software product quality and software quality in use, as well as practical instructions on how to apply the quality models.

Each one of the objectives were successfully tackled, and given solutions
